"Hamas brutally beat Gaza civilians who were tired of getting food from humanitarian aid trucks.  Hamas took the goods for itself.  This is a strong attack on humanity, kindness and charity, which I strongly condemn.

I seriously don’t know how anyone can defend these people..
They don't even care that they are being filmed
"They just keep showing their true nature. Just like a brother said, ""I need to be more religious, as there is no way I am spending eternity in Hell with Israeli's."" May Allah unveil & awaken our hearts, minds, ears & eyes, so we turn to Him. Before Dajjals arrival!"
This is textbook terrorism

"The fact that hours before they made palestinians pose with bottle waters and said ""we're not scum"" (which btw they're the ones depriving them of every basic need). At least wait some days or something."

"This is why the Palestinians in the West Bank must be armed. Instead of arming the people, the so-called “Palestinian” Authority does israel’s work for them."
I hate Israel the Nazi regime.
"Terrorists have often had young children participate in using explosives and weapons.  They are trained in #Hamas ""summer camps"" to do just that.  It's a sad reality."
"Hebron is not occupied, it's under PA.
Israel has 'security responsibility' to arrest people that threat to its country, and cause a risk in engaging terror.

Let’s be honest for once shall we? The only reason israel is interested in the hospital is because Hamas are there. It’s their base. (War crime btw). So why not call on Hamas to surrender? Surely that will be the quickest way to end this.
"WAIT!

"The ceasefire has allowed the light of truth to shine into the horror of this Genocide, carried out under cover of darkness - both in terms of no electricity & of night-time bombing.
Now, they're providing the evidence of the ethnic cleansing they are committing."
War criminals.
Any proof of that. Looks more like Hamas is shooting.
"Israeli terrorist,  75 years of occupation.

Coward Israeli terrorist & children murderers 

God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs.
Allah is all-sufficient for us and the best one to trust in."
"""Israeli snipers opened the fire and shots on the crowd, filled with men, but also women and children, families"" Alex Crawford about Israeli soldiers who shot Palestinians on their way to the north of Gaza to look for family members"
"Notice a shift in rhetoric with MSM like Sky news and the BBC.

Even they have reached a breaking point. And that is saying something.

They would never report such events. It is clear that Zionist propaganda machine is slowly dissembling."
How many civilians did IOF kill on oct 7th? 100% confirmed apache helicopter + tanks fired on civilians-investigation stalled until after war? @intifada reports using israeli intel —>  
And the world is watching
"""But.....but......Hamas etc etc"""
So it has only taken 48 days for Sky to finally start to wake up. Slowly but surely...
I am revolted by The Zionists and their apologists.  People who support zionism disgust me.  I will not vote for anyone who supports Israel.
"Was waiting for confirmation for this story because it seems so nonsensical, why do this? Horrid and if you believe in justice, there has to be accountability for this. Snipers shooting into crowds is just criminal."
Jesus Christ of almighty.
War crime continues during ceasefire
War creminlas do what they do always
There’s no crime that is too much for them to commit
One word …… Barbaric!
Funny how they forgot to mention this on the other channels.
"Israel's actions have been brought to light, and they are widely criticized as some of the most disliked due to perceived barbaric behavior."
Absolutely disgusting .
This is what Israel has been doing for years.
No words describe this horrific all too familiar war crime behaviour by Israeli soldiers .
They are the lowest of the low.
""" which was filled with men, but also women & children, families "" Even when reporting the truth … it is very telling."
That's the most moral military in the world!!!
"For the Israelis, a ceasefire means Hamas has to stop, not them."
This is what israhell occupation was doing for years
They always break promises and break covenants
During the ceasefire? That is bad.
"Where’s mr 
@piersmorgan"
Isn’t there a ceasefire?
Psychopaths
Snipers? They were spraying lead everywhere!
War Crimes
Shocking
Heartbreaking
Ceasefire.
Ceasefire?
Zionist Israel Laknatullah
They are shameless
"Absolute scum, zionist bast**ds"
So they’re breaking the ceasefire day 1
"because of 
@netanyahu
 @IsraeliPM
 was so pathethic"
Cowards !!!! And criminals
They very clearly told people not to go back North
Israel soldier cannot fight like real man
Will the USA or UK condemn Israel for such terrorist practice ???
#isarelisaterrorist #IsraeliNewNazism #Netanyahou_A_criminal_of_war
Oh God
"Seems heartless, of course people are missing under the rubble, and the biggest thing is grief.. not knowing if someone is dead or alive the hope they survive and the need inside to affirm just what happened.. there should be no shooting at all.. it is a ceasefire."
"It ain't the snipers fault, they are just looking for a promotion."
Is this not what they have been doing for 75 years?
Western propaganda media seems to have enough of Arpatheid Israel lies.
“The most moral army in the world”. Apparently.
#Israel_Is_Child_Killer_Demons
"Israel can have foot soldiers inform Palestinians not to advance to the north, and having snipers fire above is dangerous, to say the least during a ceasefire period. Israel, please use common, human sense."
Sky News is fake news
Her plastic surgeon needs to be fired!
Because North Gaza is being ethnically cleansed
ISREAL SNIPERS FIRED INTO CROWDS OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN INJUREING AND KILLING TWO THIS HAPPENED TODAY THIS IS BEYOND DISGUSTING
"Looking for your family members and going back to the houses IDF demolished is a serious threat to Israeli safety, right 
@JoeBiden
  and 
@JustinTrudeau
...it's all self-defense. Shame!"
"I have never from day one believed Israel not to violate the ceasefire deal. They have never been honest and they will never be. Hypocrisy, lies and false propaganda is what they are good at. Why shooting at innocent women, children, old and men for returning back to the land...?"
"She acknowledged Palestinian children 
P45 in the post"
#evil
.Wars and truces have their moral rules. Israel was established by gangs gathered from all countries of the world. Do not be rooted
Firing on noncombatants in other words. These are war crimes. The holocaust was horrible. But why are you as a people taking it out on the the people (muslims) that have historically protected the chosen people.
People are trying to get back to collect animals and belongs :(
End the Gazacaust now!
How is this news this is what the Israeli Genocidal Force do on a daily basis. The IGF have murdered over 14000 civilians since the start of their Genocidal assault on the Palestinian people. #EndIsraeliGenocide
Israel #nazi
"How is this even remotely acceptable, legal permissable....where is the UN? Where is sanity.
The Isreali Government is vile, loathsome and one can only wonder why it has US, UK and EU support."
"Based on all statements and actions of Israel and its Western backers, they are trying to ethnically cleanse northern Gaza and annex it.

Some of us already said this, but people are not paying enough attention. And no politician is doing anything concrete to stop that."
A savage and brutal people. Their true nature has been unveiled.
Twitter really didn't want to load this video.
"I wonder how many of those planning to march on Sunday think this is Israel ""defending itself""?"
Isn’t that terrorism
"Isreali hostages.
Palestine prisoners.

We're on to you msm."
What's been happening lately -
And they were told not too 
Imagine what will happen after the 4 days
if true this is really abominable. Disgusting.
Camera captures?
I think they said it was closed and to move to the South.
Hamas snipers!
Don’t believe anything sky or bbc says anymore sorry
But won't show the footage. What a surprise.
"Irgun!
So much
CDN."
Shame on the bringthemhomenow
This monkey nation will never be but promise
So where's the video?
VoTE blue nO maTTEr wHat!
Wasn't it part of the agreement not to return to the North because its still a war zone ? Ceasefire 7am hamas fire rockets at Israel 7.15am 
Israel breaks the cease fire
Not true.
"It’s an unpalatable truth , but if a country is attacked it will fight back , if October 7th had not happened we would not be where we are today ,"
the terms of the truce allowed movement from “north to south.” we’ve known this for days.
"When an army tells you not to go somewhere, you should listen."
Over under for time to reaction?  2 days
Not true
They deserve it 
Source of news: hamas
"""But in the bloody arithmetic of Hamas’s leaders, the carnage is not the regrettable outcome of a big miscalculation. Quite the opposite, they say: It is the necessary cost of a great accomplishment>>"
Release the hostages. That simple.
Outrageous lies. What proof has she that Israeli snipers were responsible as opposed to the far more likely Hamas/Isis snipers?
"Reconnect with their Hamas family?
Every sane person would stay away from the war zone. Only Hamas fighters are eager to going back"
Israel way to do business
They can’t go back to the north according to the ceasefire agreement
"Fact check:

There is no evidence to support this claim."
Why do people dondumb things and blame israel? They were warned north Gaza is a war zone
I don’t think the war was declared over. What did they think would happen?
Could be Hamas soldiers getting back into position.
If only SkyNews could be trusted for something…
"These are murders. And murders by military men of civilians during a war, this is a war crime."
That’s Hamas’ M.O. Not the IDF!
"ABC of Israel DNA, killing civilians, children and women. What is new in what happened?"
They need to release the video if it's true.
This is 100% true
I guess all the fliers passed out telling people that returning is dangerous and forbidden were true.
Tell me again how it is Hamas that Can't be trusted to keep a Cease fire???
The enemy is Islam.
History repeats itself.
Sky liars
"Much as every decent person hates war, I'd wouldn't mind seeing  Israel Defense Force having to confront a real army, whether the Syrian Arabs, the Russians or the Ukrainians . They're cowards"
Israel snipers = later blame hamas... What a tactics... Uncivilzed zionist
"When asked why the Israeli forces were shooting dead protesters at the Gaza crossings,
Michal Maayan — ""Well, we can't put all these people in jail."""
"They were told not to return, warned over and over again. Sent fliers not to return. But still they tried. Shots fired in air did not deter them so they were shot in the legs. A couple died. It is a war. If told not to return - don’t!"
"All the while, the Hamas government of Palestine praise them for being killed."
"Dafna Elyakim is only 14 and is held imprisoned by Hamas with her sister Ella.Her father was killed, and she was there when it happened.
Her father's partner was forced to lure even more children out of their homes, so that Hamas ..."
Idf is a terrorist organisation
"The plight of the Palistinians is not just like aparthied or holocause/genocide. It is like slavery.

The Israelis occupy and settled on enslaved Palistinian land, which they profit and benefit. When they dismantle it, they will compensate the settlement land owners/thiefs"
"This video is from the video to your toe. After a second of this, there is more room for use in the wortels, so there is a large open source in the moedized environment, and it is better to use it on the profit (you can also find it with them)."
Imagine losing your kid.
Nobody could see the sniper but our “independent” journalist
You mean they killed without raping first?  Perish the thought!
They were told not to go back north. FAFO!
"Officers should, as per S60AA have told him to remove his face covering prior to offering him words of advice.

"How many young Muslim men would it take to march on London, not to protest or climb statues, but to storm our Parliament & seats of government? The police would be too weak to stop them so the Army would have to be called in. And would we have enough soldiers and tanks to do so?"
Don't ask. Rag him off.
I thought I saw the met police saying they would remove face coverings earlier
No arrest
What about his face covering? I thought they weren't going to be allowed.
I thought face coverings are not allowed 
"Please come down Sir...

Pathetic."

Why has he got his face covered?
"What happened to zero tolerance on face coverings 
@metpoliceuk
 ?"
Too many words. The police officer should have arrested him
"Why is his face covered? 
Why isn't he being told to uncover?"
I imagine the policeman is giving him the recruitment pitch on how important it is that they employ people like him.
When you're marching in the day but got to be back to dry nans dishes at tea time
The police officer was being way too polite here
I thought no one was allowed to have their face covered 
While the police say please come down sir 
"No respect, no integration"
You need to come down Sir. No mention of face covering under Sec.60 #MetPolice
Look at the cowards with their faces covered.
Can’t be surprised at this point
"Boris told them that they needed to order water cannons to deal with any disruptions in the capital but they wouldn’t listen would they. Then along comes Khan who drags the country’s Capital City down into the gutter.

"Masked, tea towel ws"
"Usual face covered, as theyre so proud of their cause naturally..."
No batons predictably.
Why in earth are they allowed to walk with their faces covered?????
"FFS ""Please come down sir"""
Still allowed to cover their faces!
"If that was a white guy they would not ask, they would drag him down and beat him. Two tier policing again."
Pull him down! 
They should have taken his tea towel off his face then locked him up. That’s what real police would have done.
Police allow him to continue to conceal his identity even after committing a crime (for which we was not arrested of course).
Get off the art you disgusting people show some respect
"You need to come down sir if that ok with you, it's fine if not. Sorry, Carry on."
Get your baton out then

Stop appropriating Jewish heritage!

If you had any idea you would know that during this period the Arabs wore traditional clothing and the Jews were divided into traditional and modern clothing. What you see in the picture is a modern Jewish street.

"This is Shlomtzion HaMalka street in Jerusalem, first of all its named on British Princess Mery, and the second, jews first started to build outside the walls of Old Jerusalem.

The pro-Zionist comments show an interesting insight into apartheid ideology. This sense of illusion also underpinned the Nazi ideology that influenced the ruling Afrikaaners of South Africa. The resemblance are uncanny.

Yes. It was a British protectorate. It was not a separate country by any definition.
"The point, which all of you are missing, is that it was a thriving area. It didn't have to hope Israel gave them enough water, have Israel come to their houses, kick them out then demolish their homes. One minute you're having dinner, five min later everything you own is gone."
"It shouldn't be difficult, but for some reason too many Arabs do find it difficult and they try to eliminate Israel and constantly fail."
Imagine forcing yourself onto someone’s land then expecting them to be ok with it. The Jewish people who lived there before stand with Palestinians. Israel was meant for Israelites and you’re not them. Settler colonialism and the Zionist colonial project will fail.
He also put the mufti in his position because (1) the mufti's brother had moderate views and (2) the Husseini's pressured and boxed out the other notable families. Haj Amin wasn't even one of the final three names from whom the officeholder was to be selected.
"Is there something I said above that you think is untrue? Because none of it is the least bit controversial, just historical facts."

"After the Ottoman Empire lost control of the area it was under British rule. It wasn’t a desolate wasteland, it also wasn’t “ Palestine” , there’s no such thing in history"

These are additiial photd roving hat
This is a jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem.
"Prior to 1948, it was British.  Prior to WWI, it was the Ottoman Empire.  Palestine was not a country!"
Nice picture of the Jewish section of Jerusalem.
"It was not invaded in 48.Ages of Alyah and Zionist immigration went before that.P. was never a country/people but a region which is now Jordan,Israel, etc.Mid 19th cent. max 750.000 inhabitants,not empty but sparsely populated. Pic is from the 30 s : British ruled the place."
#FreePalestineFromIsraeINOW
I've never seen a group of people less self-aware of how poorly they are presenting themselves to the wider world.
the tiktok army
They can’t fight they can’t dance what exactly they can do ?
I think my soul puked 
Ttiktok force is happy and dancing now .they achieved very big in gaza  because they killed their own 3 hostages .
Ok
Palestine will be free InshaAllah
"Let’s hope they keep posting like this. 

There are still a few people left on Earth who don’t hate the Zionists yet who still need to be reached."
They look like janitors or zookeepers
They look great; no need for any more American money for this stuff.
Last time I saw this many unattractive women I was at a local Walmart.
I want to see them on the day of judgement.
"How it started 

How it’s going "
Good luck insha'Allah
"They make white people dancing, so much better."
Zombies
shameless
Peppa pig version army
Incredibly cringe 
"It's disgusting 
Warmonger, Physchopt clown "
Practising for a rave party. In Hell.
"Israelis like to dance, they do it a lot
Just google dancing israelis"
"Whoever raised her, please start using protection and whoever is going to marry her you do the same please."
I've seen white people dance better than this
I guess their pants are brown already this time.
Ceasefire in Gaza NOW!
"It seems like a celebration of their ongoing failures.

Al-Qassam ghosts have significantly contributed to their loss of composure."
"From the ""safety"" of Israel, it's funny. They will find out  soon enough if they send in the tiktok girls."
Tiktok army
Genuinely so ugly
How anyone can celebrate ? After killing thousands of innocents
"Israeli Dance Forces, wonders why they are getting curb stomped in Gaza."
Love  them
"Looks like they’re having fun. 

How is it down in the tunnels?"
It’s called having fun and laughing and dancing. Tough to do in a burka. 
Good on them for having fun . Difference between you pro Palestinians it’s all death and hate. Israel all about life and happiness?! Could learn a few things!
Oh no! Not dancing!
I am sure I am not the only one who thought of this
"Oh God, grant victory to our vulnerable brothers in Palestine"
"Oh God, your victory, who promised God is great"
": will try to save life even if it’s  
 : will try to take life even if it’s "
"Oh God, support the unseen, support the innocent, Amen"
Don't stop talking about Palestine 
If I was a American tax payer I'd want my money back 
Children of light
Grotesque
They are exuberantly happy
Tiktouers
I like our chances
How can they pass the test?  Or is there any soldiers standards for the idf?  It is even a shameful thing for other soldier group around the world
We'll see how long these ones last
Embarrassing
Boom!
They are all from Syosset or Escondido
This is a dance so that the US will send more sweet tax money to Israel.
How are they not embarrassed?
Some from Sodoma some from Gomorra
Awkward
A few moments later

"Have they changed their diapers???

"These dances definitely arent middle eastern, and i think we all know exactly where they came from."
"yeah girls, keep it going! give us nothing."
'Stunning and Brave' ...
What the heck is this?!
How did they escape from this zoo?

Dance left the chat

Hope their families go through the same.

I’m actually embarrassed for them.

Disgusting... yikes ...
They made this voluntarily?
A worm in hot
I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan
So embarrassing
Sorry but God's chosen people break dance doesn't feel very native to the region
Weird.
Israel's biggest legacy will be that they made the wider population around the world sympathize with the early to mid 1930s Nazis 
Hahahahahaha
It's a demonstration for how good is the diapers they use.
They look fun!!
Peace be upon you from the Lord of Merciful
This was so painful to watch
Hope these pigs have to get a SMA bomb ...

Not sure how Israel is going to cope without Ireland’s support.
"LOL, what is happening to Ireland is what Ireland does to itself! 
@Israel
 is not doing anything but defending itself, they are being Attacked. Gaza could not survive without Israel, Gaza voted for Hamas, so Gaza gets what Hamas does it Gaza! If Gaza were to get rid of Hamas, they…"
Those that worship evil as you Clare are just as guilty of it.
I will take my advice from a country not known for alcoholism or blowing up the queens horses. Thank you
So Clare Daly wants to pull Ireland out of the E.U.?
Of course you stand with terrorists.  Ireland has a long history of doing so.

It would be more helpful if they joined the fight. These are enough to turn to war around.....

Apparently they got green light to do whatever they want. China doesn’t think so  we’ll see
Damn that's crazy why is nobody reporting about these pogroms in the West Bank?? 
Palestine and Hamas are one in the same. The both follow Ilsam which calls for the colonization fo the world and to remove all occupiers (nonMuslims) from this earth. And you know that! There are no innocent Muslims. Islam is a war ideology 100% and if you support that you…
"Israel has been committing atrocities in the West Bank for a very long time as part of its settler expansion strategy. 

Under cover of “war on Hamas” Israel is conducting a massive land grab with forcible removal of the Palestinian population. With consent of the int’l community"
War ain't a solution no matter the justification or side one feels is entitled to strike the other. World powers should strive to mediate for peace & tranquility instead of fueling war by supplying weapons to the side(s) they support.

A quick search of the net would have answered.
That looks like burning trash bro …
 Are you with the Mossad?! No. You’re not. You don’t know if Hamas is there or not.
And you know for a fact this is what’s happening?  Where’s the evidence? Just like the hospital right?
Listen to Carter in 2013 about Israel Hamas
No that’s hezbolah’s fault.
"Just say you support terrorists, and hate Jews."
"It’s a war on Hamas.
that is where they live and work."
"When you realize that the weapon of choice for Hamas is dead babies on the internet, you will realize what kind of war you are fighting. A propaganda war. How do you get weapons ?"
"Why do you lie ?

Hamas has units in the West Bank 
They are being eliminated .

Did you ask also why Hamas burned Israeli houses and actually burned people alive including babies ?"
Israel should take there land back
"Hamas hides weapons, rockets, etc. even if they moved them, they can bring them back. You don’t have the intel dude."
"Extremely one sided and biased news by US media has provided cover to Israel to operate in this brutal manner.

US, UK 'mainstream' media that's controlled by a lobby, has always taken a pro-occupation line and misled the viewers and readers.

The tragedy is that these 10-12 news…"
It is their belief and religion.
Liar. No it’s not
"Is a war on Muslims. 

This is the beginning. 

Stay wired the next 10 years."
"If this is true, it’s a problem."
No Hamas in the West Bank? The Financial Times this year reported the opposite - a growing presence...
WAR IS AGAINST HAMAS THATS WHY PALESTINIANS EVACUATED ONLY HAMAS IS LEFT IN GAZA.
"That’s a flat lie, Hamas operatives are also in West Bank. Terrorists who are planing attacks and helping are in the West Bank as well."
"You don’t know Hamas- you don’t know where they are, where they store their weapons or where they fire them from"
Bwahahahahahahahaha
"Yes there is Israel’s military said it was targeting an underground “terror compound” beneath the mosque that it said was being used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad to organize an imminent attack. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, called the activity going on…"
Palestinians everywhere are supporting Hamas.  Maybe that's why. Not hard.
Hamas started a war.  That's what this is.
Go Israel
How in the world would YOU know?
Israel arrests 63 Hamas operatives in West Bank
Must watch to understand the situation!
No hamas there?
"There are plenty of Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives in Judah and Shomron.

"
So your claim was invalidated by CNN.
"Yeah, sure you know the Hamas makes sure their terrorist activities are retained within the Gaza Strip."
"To make way for

Where is this “Palestine” you speak of?
Yes there is...
Yes there is. Do your homework
Liar.
"Just to make clear, this happens on a weekly+ basis in the west bank. Settlers burned the village next to my family just a month ago. This is the apartheid. Ongoing war, ethnic cleaning, intimidation, terror."
Rockets from Hezbollah were shot into Israel.  Pay attention
If not now then when?
Palestine doesn’t exist tho
Ethnic cleansing
#PalestinianGenocide
If only everyone else could see what you see
Where there are peacefuls there is violence.
Those settlers are extraordinarily aggressive and doing as quickly as possible while world looking elsewhere
"if Israel is forced to chase after them into the territories, it means they’re there"
Moderate Palestinians say don't go there. A German tourist and his family were almost killed by a mob of Islamists there this year.
Why don’t you talk about 7 October? Everything has reason.
Looks like fake news
"Of course there is Hamas in the west bank. The PA rules the West Bank, but Hamas is there as well as Islamic Jihad and more organisations."
"Im reading The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine by Ilan Pappé, and they clearly want to end what they started in 1948. Imo they won't stop until the whole of Palestine is theirs."
"NO, HAMAS is attacking from West Bank & Lebanon, they are not only in GAZA."
"It is not war bro,it is invations work up !"
Because they’re evil?
This is the truth about this fight that most people on both sides won't admit
What’s your favorite brand of mass murder?
"They're not homes, their weapons supplies for Hamas and PIJ

Nice effort to turn around the Israeli expression onto Israel."
Hamas is everywhere.
Absolute nonsense. Hamas is totally active in PA areas.
Hamas does have a presence in the West Bank. The stated objective of Israel’s response is to eliminate Hamas. They never said their operations would be limited to Gaza. Any commentator worth their salt should have grasped these points two weeks ago.

Oil and gas rich Muslim countries has more foreign workers than the total population of Gaza. Yet they choose not to help and take in refugees over the last many years. It suits Oil and gas rich Muslim countries to keep a Muslim population trapped in conflict with Israel.
No. I have never seen 'leaders' like we have now in Europe. So out of touch with people in their own countries. And I'm old.

The arrogance of ‘Europe stands with Palestine’ is breathtaking.

Which of you stands with the hostages?"
You are one of a kind  thank you for being real human ..
Funny how the governments says one thing but the people says another
"“A baby was cut out of a pregnant woman and beheaded and then the mother was beheaded.”

“Mass rape so brutal that they broke their victims’ pelvis – women, grandmothers, children.”

“We have babies with their heads cut off. Bodies without hands, without legs, without genitals.”"
The EU leaders should be embarrassed and ashamed of their hypocrisy.

There is no genocide
You don't speak for me.

HAMAS-ISIS
No - Muslims stand with other muslims
An Irish European MEP must surely be the ultimate in grifting?
"No. The IDF communicates with them first before they attack. Then they drop a small bomb on the top as a final warning before they drop the building. - Unlike Hamas, they don’t want innocents killed."
You asked for war.
You know the civilians were warned. Hamas is using human shields by placing their assets in residential buildings.
Well done Israel.
Hamas was also in the building and Israel gave an hour warning.
We call this half-ass journalism.
"War crimes r only counted if perpetrators r of anti west front, if it is committed by US/ western allies then it is not a war crime but fighting terrorists."
Hamas cells were operating out of here. Clear W
"They were warned, not to mention the building was being used to house terrorists and manufacture weapons and explosives."
They knock the roof to tell people to get out and you know that.  It’s the hamas terrorists conducting war crimes.
"War never changes.

Maybe you should advocate for peace instead of throwing out buzz words to feed the beast."
Take that for your war crime... 
All Gaza is terorist HQ
"war crime is what hamas just did to civilians, yes there would be consequences, they forgot to think..."
"Oh wah, now you're worried about war crimes. I hope they turn that whole area into a parking lot."
I guess you've missed some of the news before now. You will now witness what happens when you murder women and children. I don't care what happens. Not. At. All.
Sending 5000 missiles and rockets into Israel is even more of a war crime.  I don't think Palestinians can complain whatever happens now in response or retaliation. They deserve it.  All of them.
Journos right now
"You are committing War Crimes and gloating over it.  When a day comes in which like Hitler, Israel has to answer, your comments will be there to see in your participation of the Genocide of Palestinians."
"Sorry, but nothing that Palestinians can say now really means anything after what they have said here "
GFY Alan.
"Oh, you are concerned about war crimes?"
"But, but, but it’s a *good war crime” and you have to learn the difference between good war crimes (Israel) and bad war crimes (Hamas, Turkey, Iran, Vladimir Putin. . . . )"
"No a war crime is killing innocent civilians, raping them & parading them through the streets."
Send their asses to the 42 virgins that await them ...
"Hamas occupied building, legitimate target."
"...so, a day which started with war crimes ends with one as well?"
"What do you think we mean when we say “war”? Hint: It is this, but it’s not what you saw happen to the Israelies this morning."
Nuts!
Gaza needs the Dresden treatment.
Only solution is to give back Palestinian their land
Israel should level every building in Gaza.
"What are the odds Alan isn't heterosexual and fetishizes being dominated by Islamic militants?

I'd wager 100%."
Some jokers will say it's hamas headquarters
Eye for an eye. Hamas shouldn’t have started with war crimes
"Good, needed to be done."
Dude it’s just a building. They warned them before bombing it. Meanwhile call out the war crime by Hamas
If you didn't get the full story Israel asked the occupants to leave the building
The explosions started at ground level and then the building fell straight down. I don't believe that was an airstrike.
you get what you put out.
"Sure.. but housed Hamas terrorists. So, no."
Save your outrage. This is only the beginning of the dismantling of Hamas infrastructure. Palestinians  had 75 yrs to make peace. Gaza had 20 yrs to become another Dubai after Israel’s unilateral withdrawal - ditching the ‘land for peace’ principle cos of international pressure.
Wait 'til you hear about what all happened before that.
"Why would they do that totally, completely & utterly out of the blue?  It's a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma…"
How many people were in that building?
"There is an extensive compilation of war crimes committed by the Israeli occupiers.
Since 1948!"
Hypocrisy of Western Media 
"Netanyahu finds himself entangled, drawn towards the demands of extreme right-wing factions that sustain his political survival and shroud him from the weight of corruption allegations. In the eyes of the secular majority within Israel,  and the global community, his actions are…"
"When you send 5,000 missiles into Israel, what do you expect. Ever heard of cause and effect?"
LMAO. Jounalist has thoughts.
"Conflict's devastating impact knows no boundaries, affecting both lives and infrastructure. It's a grim reminder of the toll of war."
Good.
"You forgot about the part where the IDF clears the civilians out of the building through repeated warnings to Palestian leaders they are targeting the building. 

Yes, a very noble strategy that unfortunately results in not enough bad guys getting killed."
Nothing is a crime if it is against Hamas. Let this sink in.
war crimes by Israel
Hamas apologist
Hit it again.
Sure. Now what did Hamas did with innocent civilians going on with their lives a few hours prior in Israel? In your view are they formal army following Geneva conventions?
Looks like a good start to me.
"""War crimes"" is such a strange concept. It's war."
"Nonsense it was a control demolition. They had actors, film crews & SAR already pre positioned all around the building all laughing as they “blow it up”."
Is this current?
Controlled explosions 
Free Palestinian
"Is it though?  I mean, if they were using it for military purposes, it isn't.  Doesn't seem clear to me."
That's an answer to this clear war crime. 
This you?
Go away
You know nothing about international law it seems. The building was used as a Hamas barracks
"Not if it's war, darling."
War crime
"{Yes! Certainly, the victory of Allah is near}"
"This video from 2021, lol"
"Serve them right, they asked for it"
“War crime” is a nonsensical concept invented by the West to label their enemies.
I'm sure they will (and have) broken all the rules on both sides.
Nazi alert
"Israel marked the building with a lighter round, first, to let everyone know it was a target and that they should leave."
Not even close to a war crime.
"Clear? On what basis? If it housed command and/or control elements of Hamas, was it still a “clear” war crime? You’re a journalist so it’s fundamental to your profession to exaggerate or fabricate narratives."
Hamas Headquarters.
Now level the rest of it.
What!? This was a Hamas HQ. And they even gave them a warning shot for non-combatants to evacuate
It wasn't. As you can see from the Al Jazeera broadcast they knocked first to give everyone a chance to evacuate.
It’s just a collateral damage.
They took hostages. Pretty sure the rules are out the window.
It was empty. Israel warns occupants before it levels buildings.
There was a warning strike. It was caught on live TV
"Oh, Russian 
@MintPressNews
 ! Want to hear your comments on Russian atrocities in Ukraine!  But I'm sure you will be silent."
The Earth has reached its limit in tolerating more wars; past experiences have shown that they do not produce any significant outcomes. War is not a solution.
"chill man, isreal is defending itself.
lol"
"Ya , Israel seems to really dislike media companies in Gaza. It is not the first time they have targeted media buildings  and or journalists in the occupied territories. I guess they don’t want the truth to get out. And that would be the truth about their war crimes."
They gave everyone a roof knock beforehand so what's your issue? That was a Hamas office building.
You are a clear example of a beta male who talks big behind a keyboard but won't put his money where his mouth is.
"It's where Hamas has headquarters.
Behind civilians.
They're not innocent civilians because they know they harbor Terrorists."
"We're coming for our children, elderly, women and men who were kidnapped to Gaza yesterday. Alive or dead, they'll get home.
I feel sad about all the people whom Hamas uses as human shields, but they won't stop us from bringing our children back."
Israel has been committing war crimes since 1948.
"When it is done by someone who supports the USA, it is called ""defense"", and when it is done by someone who does not support the USA then it is called ""terrorism""."
Not a war crime.  This was justified.
"If Hamas is using the building, it's a military target for Israel. If there are civilians there, the war criminal is Hamas. Using human shields is a war crime."
The “war crime” slogan been gettin tossed around a lot nowadays. It’s always fun to see because it’s a clear indicator of which side that person has chosen.
"Looks like a movie scene, whereas it's real!"
I would be willing to wager everyone was warned that they were going to take it down and the there were no civilians in it when it was destroyed unless the warning wasn't listened to.
This is an old video . have seen this video before the recent escalation
Liar
"Epic. I love watching this, reminds me of watching the Iraq invasion and the early 2000s. The difference is that this one is justified. This one is great content I hope Israel finishes this off for one state solution."
I guess you conveniently left out the fact that Israel gave warning to the building before taking it down.
It housed AP media officers etc. however they did in fact give  MINUTES notice before the bombings for everyone to vacate the building. More than the other side
Israel had the decency to warn them.
Pathetic
"Right, so you expect Israel to stand still while its citizens are being killed."
They were warned.
HQ for Hamas in Gaza. Legitimate military target.
"What else was in there Alan , you hack"
It doesn’t count when you are West or Israël. That’s western rule based order.
Response to a war crime
Military target.   Well deserved.
So what
"Yes, and a Hamas command and control operation in the basement."
Sturdy architecture they’ve got in Gaza
"Not a war crime if it had Hamas offices, as reported, or if they gave warning to civilians to evacuate beforehand, as the IDF usually does"
"Israel never gets this, people without homeland will never sit silent. Give them their home back and live in peace!!!"
"Two towers in #Gaza City, which host media offices and residential apartments, collapsed after they were hit by an airstrike. It was not immediately clear if there were casualties. Follow @CNN for live updates as Israel says it's ""at war"" after today’s surprise attack by #Hamas:…"

Great to see.
Hamas is responsible for whatever follows.

"You are kidding, right?"
awwwwww
"Stay tuned, more to come. Gaza will soon be turned into a parking lot - something useful at least."
I'm presuming they knocked first which the palestinians  absolutely did not.
Good  because Palestine started this

Seems like more and more #FF #Detonation
Looks like a controlled demolition to me.
Why should Israel follow any human rights as if hat hamas did was well within human rights.
International community & leaders only care for certain groups
Amongst all this horror an innocent smile
"It’s not a war crime, do research before sharing."
"3/10 for the props. That’s clearly smoke.

7/10 for the idea. Very smart propaganda attempt.

9/10 for the acting. Very convincing.

Overall… 6/10 - try again."
It's an avalanche of lies.
A Pallywood Production
it's not phosphor
Lol it's just smoke
Pallywood producers go brrrr
You don’t put out white phosphorus with water.  the propaganda runs deep with Hamas.
If that was WP then why are they out there with buckets of water?
"Looks more like someone’s dirty underwear caught fire. 
#Pallywood"
"See?  It has been proven a lie. An honest person would delete/retract this, but Hamas/Palestine and their supporters are not honest. 

They have no truth to stand on, so they rely on spreading lies, Without lies, they would have nothing to say."
"It’s a smoke canister. 

Evil always lies. 

#Taqiyya"
Yet another lie…
"Posts like this is why

"Water won’t put out Willy P. 
Do research before posting. Those are smoke grenades, probably thrown by Hamas."
"May Allah keep them safe.
Hoping for their best Safety."
"Yeah, that doesn’t look manufactured for the camera. Also, when dealing with REAL Willy Pete, water doesn’t work."
"A bunch of Hamas fighters just waiting for it to drop
100% Palliwood"
Always lying Hamas terrorist supporters and getting caught.
Why are the kids running to it then? 
The propensity to lie is amazing.   No phosphorous bomb there.
"That is a smoke bomb, stop lying to your followers"
"Do you think these people represent Hamas? Why are Gaza schools being bombed with internationally banned white phosphorus?
These schools are attended by civilians and are affiliated with UNRWA"
Its illegal and war crime to drop white phosphorus on civilians
"And just like that they’re all scientists… 

You don’t have to be too smart to see this is just regular smoke. Leave that area"
Staged propaganda. They’re terrible at making fake videos. It’s humorous.
"Notice how the Palestinian
State sponsored medias won't show this to the public ! All they want to do is stir up hate among the people ! Expose the lies people ! Don't be blinded by the  media !"
Hahhahahhahahahahahaha
""" investigative journalist"" "
Funny it's almost as if they knew someone was going to throw it off the top of the adjacent building lol.
Hahahahaha that's a smoke bomb like we played with on Independence day. 
False news.  That is a common smoke canister.
"This is a guy with a following on Instagram of 2 million.
White phosphorus cannot be put out with little water or other conventional methods.
You can see the second canister being thrown off the building behind them.

Fake news."
They use lethal weapons against civilians 
"Lmfao, what is this even supposed to be?"
If it was 2001 they would call it “White Cake”.
A PHD candidate that doesn't know how phosphorous burns?
"this is a parody account, right?"
"They are doing it deliberately to prove a bigger conflict and are committing war crimes knowing that they will get away with it, they think no one can hold them accountable ."
"That's not WP.  Get a clue, then speak."
That guy looks pretty well rested for being under siege for 3+ weeks.
That's not white phosphorous. This is what white phosphorous looks like. Those are plain old smoke grenades.
#FakeNews
"another L
you re collecting them"
"The thing that amazes me is that your lies are so blatantly obvious, that nobody believes you. There’s no chance that anybody with integrity would take you seriously."
nice smoke grenades lmao
This looks like smoke. Did you verify they authenticity of this ?
FAKE NEWS. That's not what a bomb looks like.. You really got to try harder with that fake news.
"This is a propaganda clip, and a very bad one at that."
This is not white phosphorus!
"Free Free Palestine 

#CeasefireForGaza"
It's smoke
One can clearly See this fake video 
This is just smoke
"Tell me more about all these people waiting around with buckets before the ""bomb"" even hits the ground. Look closely you can see the guy running over with a bucket before it even hits the ground."
White phosphorus burns at 1500°f/800°C that is smoke
Yeah that not what white phosphorus looks like
Breaking: Sulaiman posted another weak piece of propaganda.
Looks like a smoke grenade got thrown.  Looks like propaganda videos.
Just like Israel bombed a hospital?
Pretty odd that people are running up to an actively dispersing “chemical weapon” with no visible effects
"It’s war time.. Unfortunately there are no crimes. If there were, your side did them first. Instead of stirring up more crap against one another why don’t you turn your negative energy into positive?"
" Christian’s sit through mass service delivered by a priest in the Roman Catholic Chapel in Gaza, while Israel drops a bomb right outside.

IT’S NOT THE MUSLIM ISSUE ONLY"
"I would claim there is a significant difference between what is shown on the video, and how it actually looks. 

Stop lying and claiming this as evidence. A ""journalist"" should know better. But it's getting you the follows and likes, huh?"
That is not a phosphorus bomb. Fake news.
"Nice white phosphorus that doesn't glow white hot like a second sun lmao

You're gonna get what's coming for you. Soon"
Hollywood
"Let me be clear: just because it's legal doesn't mean I think it is right.  With that said, a 'war crime' is a legal, rather than emotive, term.  This whole thing is crap, but facts still matter.
""White phosphorus munitions can legally be used on battlefields to make smoke…"
That was thrown off a roof.  Look at the speed and arc of it falling.
"Lol, ya seems legit."
WAR CRIMES
Lol no way you’re walking up to white phosphorus like that.
"That's not white phosphorus.

Again, you are a brazen liar."
"If it was actual phosphor, don't even try getting close to it.

But that was a smoke grenade."
Post like this one is the reason we can not trust Hamas propagandists.
"Phospherous bombs r not illegal anywhere. Wat they r, is extremely incendiary. But basically , they create smoke screens."
"It was extremely clear from the video this was not white phosphorus, or an attack.... 

Love the 
@CommunityNotes
 here "
White phosphorus is not illegal to use in war.
And that is not white phosphorus that was s very likely a tear gas grenade or a smoke grenade
"Stop spreading lies....  you are losing credibility daily!!!  

Be objective....   You are hoping for crimes and that's scary..."
"There is no ""proportion"" in war."
You’re officially the biggest clown on this app
Looks like smoke grenades
Thank you for not deleting this so everyone can see first hand how bad people are whiling to lie for hamas
That is NOT Willie Pete. They would have known it immediately. Smoke cans only.
Qasem Soleimani please come back we need you once again. 
"That’s not White Phos

It’s smoke

Why keep lying ?"
Fake.
The real war crimes occurred on 10/7.
"This is not a white phosphorus bomb but a smoke canister

You can see the second grenade fly in

Nice try #Palliwood"
It looks like it came off the building they’re all standing under
“Investigative journalist” who gets community noted every time he posts! 
"Yeah dude, that’s not true."
The lies hurt your cause.
Notice the words “accused” and “appears”? Certainly doesn’t mean confirmed.
heartbreaking  But Allah help is near
Is humanity a mournful fleeting byproduct of evolution or a brightly blooming cosmic tree? The choice is ours.
being silent is a crime 
"Just so that you know white phosphorus munitions can legally be used on battlefields to make smoke screens, for illumination, mark targets or burn enemy positions."
"Like I said before, this is not white phosphorus! 

Also civilian school running in a battlefield, after getting the evacuation order three weeks back.  Hmm interesting."
Dawg they have no where to go and yes this isn’t 100% WP but I have other videos of the same area of 100% a WP Attack
"Her screams... no mother should go through this 

Sorry P@lestine"
Great performance for Netflix.
That’s not what a white phosphorus bomb looks like 
Not war crimes.
"Fake, again."
Liar community notes called your propaganda again
Looks like it was thrown from the roof.
Spreading misinformation. 
You know when you know. This video made me laugh. It’s a smoke drop.
Stop the lies!!!
That’s not white phosphorus. You’re just sharing lies as usual. Take that community note.
Terroristic liars.
I don't think this is a phosphorus bomb.
Great actors. 
Propagandist and liar… not a journalist
"Dude, can you please have your breaking reports make minimal sense?

If it dropped White Phosphorus, the Gazans couldn't just be there, photograph it, and run towards it.

They wouldn't be able to breathe and would be burned.

You guys aren't even trying to lie properly."
Eat up all the propaganda that comes out of Gaza
More total propaganda from Hamas.
That is a smoke grenade.  This is how white phosphorus looks like:
Willy P sticks to you.
If you think this is white phosphorous then I've got some beach front property in Montana to sell you.
So your big lying 
Smoke grenades.  Why are you lying?
You definitely can't put out a phosphorus fire with water and blankets.
"Here is my community note 

I noted that their note was not helpful - join me please"
Nope. This is the real deal:
What is that actually ?
Source: his feelings
Propaganda.
That's not white phosphorus
The propaganda is bordering on an SNL skit.
"That doesn’t appear to be white phosphorus… it would be on fire when it comes down.. 
white phosphorus ignites when it comes in contact with oxygen…"
Does this guy ever post something true?
Why do this if Hamas is underground? 
"Never use water to control white phosphorus. It produces phosphine, very deadly gas."
More dangerous rhetoric.
How he stays in grad school and not loose any credentials is a mystery
Oh look! You got a community note 
That’s gas!
This is white phosphorus landing.
Hamas must surrender immediately to stop the war
"LOL, you mean a guy threw a smoke bomb off of the roof?"
"Investigative Journalist, PHD Candidate, MA Philosophy, PGCE Mathematics, LLB Law, Author.... and Liar"
Your profile says it all. “Journalist” but doesn’t verify facts!
Hide the kids!
White phosphorous   Sure dude.
"I'm not sure where you earned your Ph.D., but if you show them that post, I'm sure they'll reimburse you for your tuition."
"Sulaiman is a liar.

Nothing he says can be believed."
This is white phosphorus
That is white Phosphorus
Inhaling that smoke would’ve killed all of them instantly if it was white phosphorus
He is the most community noted person on this app. Only time before this is community noted and showing him lying yet againg.

"And the other side would be honest as the day is long, no propaganda coming from there."
"They did, it’s clearly planned"
This is not a white phosphorus bomb but a smoke cannister; you can see the second grenade fly in.  White phosphorus videos:  
"That's smoke. I know because I used smoke grenades before.
Nice try, Sadly some fall for the lies."
Demo of a smoke grenade:
 that was flung of the roof 
Why would the IDF do this? It was refuted to many times
"Wait, who would have thought they'd be LYING to us??..."
Crazy how everyone’s into these propaganda videos over there.
"You Arabs just can’t stop the lies! You lie about Israel to everyone. You lie to yourselves about the fake God you worship, you lie to your wives about being real men, and now this!  When does it stop?"
You are really scraping the bottom of the barrel here.
White phosphorus isn't something you can go out with your jacket and put it out
While phosphorus. LMAO.. That's smoke grenades. No one would be standing that close to White Phosphorus.. 
"Not only is it not WP. It is 100% staged. Do Palestinians sit around in groups with buckets full of water waiting for random ‘bombs’ to fall into empty parking lots so they can extinguish them?

If it was WP you couldn’t put it out with water, and you can’t get anywhere near…"
Busted! More Palestinian propaganda.
 this page has become like The Onion or Babylon Bee 
This something else
Phosphor! Phosphor! He's definitely taken too much phosphor 
I see smoke and a bunch of military age men.
"fake,dron of Hamas drop this."
That aint no willy p
This is just a smoke granade not white phosphor
Oh white smoke falling really slow someone Palestinian through that from the roof above

Right is that real ? Looks fake big time
"That's a smoke pot.

"Clearly that’s not a phosphorus bomb. Its actually clearly not a bomb, nor does it have phosphorus, nor was it dropped from a plane… #wofts"
" but people can attain humanity if they work for it. We should never let go of our humanity and never forget."""
