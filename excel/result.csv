I seriously don’t know how anyone can defend these people
They dont even care that they are being filmed
They just keep showing their true nature Just like a brother said I need to be more religious as there is no way I am spending eternity in Hell with Israelis May Allah unveil  awaken our hearts minds ears  eyes so we turn to Him Before Dajjals arrival
This is textbook terrorism
His cries for his mom and dad it’s so horrible This whole country must be dismantled The beginning of the end they’re trying to make their final blow

True evil on the loose

This is what happens to the Palestinians that are supposedly Free
In front of his children 
The IDF is a terrorist organization That is all
The fact that hours before they made palestinians pose with bottle waters and said were not scum which btw theyre the ones depriving them of every basic need At least wait some days or something
US standards of civilization
This is why the Palestinians in the West Bank must be armed Instead of arming the people the socalled “Palestinian” Authority does israel’s work for them
I hate Israel the Nazi regime
Terrorists have often had young children participate in using explosives and weapons  They are trained in Hamas summer camps to do just that  Its a sad reality
"Hebron is not occupied its under PA
Israel has security responsibility to arrest people that threat to its country and cause a risk in engaging terror

Fake news spreader are equal to crime doer
Keep spreading propaganda

British police looks different do t spread fake
Nah man i think they look like this
"Since that is not a British policeman and that incident did not occur in Britain I can safely say

This is what Zionist propaganda looks like"
I dunno Mebbe British cops should start carrying guns Just sayin
It’s interesting to me that the WHO is not calling for the release of the hostages
"
  this morning the IDF delivered fuel to AlShifa Hospital

Hamas stopped them from receiving it
look into the facts condemn Hamas
all the proof is here "
"the situation is horrific

here below proof"
And that is not to mention the bombs hitting AlShifaHospital and other facilities in Gaza
Let’s be honest for once shall we The only reason israel is interested in the hospital is because Hamas are there It’s their base War crime btw So why not call on Hamas to surrender Surely that will be the quickest way to end this
"WAIT 

Is this the same Tedros guy who helped China make sure that nobody knew that Covid leaked from Wuhan

Cool cameo"
Get Hamas to distribute its resources Hamas actually confiscated fuel Israelis gave to Shifa for emergency purposes You forgot to report that Why is that

Why don’t you ask Hamas terrorists to release files from their storage Or why they did not let the Israelis’ fuel to get to the hospital By the way the authorities  in Gaza are Hamas members
Did the WHO condemn hamas for preventing the arranged fuel delivery
Crimes against humanity
You mean End Hamas Now  Fixed it for you
Not one word about Hamas using this hospital as their HQ for the past 14 years
Horrible What have you done to release our hostages
You should blame Hamas for this They have plenty of fuel started the war and placed key strategic locations below the hospital
Stop lying Tedros
The world cannot stand silent when hospitals are used as human shields for terror command centers
Blame Hamas
Any update on the wellbeing of the hostages

What’s the answer"
"By this picture from today they still have electricity

So you are lying Hamas or both"

In the comments repeatedly pointing to Hamas Hamas Hamas a crucial misunderstanding of the core issue is evident Its clear that the emergence of Hamas isnt the primary problem but rather a result of the prolonged occupation and the resultant suffering of Palestinians
"IDF provided fuel  are they using it 

If not why not"
"Just wait for the Israelis the pro genocides to say 
WHO is antisemitic 
WHO is Hamas"
Resign NOW
Im so sorry 
As an immediate measure UN should immediately ask all civilians to separate themselves from terrorists No country tells its enemy for over 10 days that ground assault will start soon Still they did not separate themselves from terrorists Israel gave civilians enough time
We are listening
Surrender Hamas
Funny that the only thing no one is calling for is Hamas to surrender That is the easiest and most justified solution
Hamassurrenderow
the hospital is not functioning as a hospital anymore is your funniest take so far You seem to not be up to date Try to read up about it It might inform you about the reason for the ongoing combat in the area
My heart cries so much for these innocent lives that are the victims of this situation God bless all
What about the hostages Have you managed to get in touch with them
"
 you said on Twitter this morning you wanted to address this crisis I hope you’re working today sir"
Culprit is HAMAS
my heart hurts for those doctors facing mass losses

Meanwhile  here in Australia our government has signed up with America so we hear little else but“Hamas Terrorists” and Hamas atrocities  totally ignoring the REASON that HAMAS exists  just as Nelson Mandela rose to power after 27 years in gaol for being “a terrorist”
Do you work for Hamas sir
"Know one believes the WHO
Anyways they all seem to have working iPhones after 3 days of no power I need update my phone to that type of battery"
Interesting how well the hospital is holding up the attack pretty tough guards you got there
Why not airdrop medical aid to AlShifa hospital Jordan did that for its field hospital
Why is gunfire at the hospital that shows truly that Hamas base is there if not there wont be gunfire at the hospital
They were told to evacuate 3 weeks ago There has been a corridor open every day for a weekWhy arent you getting medical personnel and patients out of a hospital that you know has Hamas under it around it and integrated into it Could the medical be part of Hamas
Cease fire 
Lets talk about the hospitals in Gaza

Massive respect to them all 
Freaking Awesome

Hopefully our elected leaders who are supposed to represent us will listen to reason and force a ceasefire"

Alhamdulillah…Thank you brothers  sisters May Allah Bless all of you Amen…
Well said there is hope
I appreciate my Jewish brothers standing up for whats right 
By God Almighty there are Jews who have mercy and do not accept injustice even if the oppressor is their brother A scene that brought tears to my eyes when I saw the scene

Congratulations to them Coexistence is still better

Because they are coward and hypocrite nation
"So lets recap the Ceasefire today
1 Israel Shot at crowds around Al Rantisi Hospital injuring 1 man at least
2 Israel shot into a crowd of people trying to reconnect with their families in the North injuring 7 and Killing 2
3 Israel flew drones over Rafah Crossing 12"
even sky is struggling to suppress the reality
Has the ceasefire been broken already
"Better to die fighting for freedom then be a prisoner all the days of your life
Bob Marley"
Haaretz has said that racism is a big problem in that place and the regime has incited the far right to the point that they feel they’re untouchable
Why is Sky News not showing the images But they could show the fake command center Do the images have to be approved by someone The painful thing about this when the hosts interview an Israeli on this glaring evidence they will allow them conveniently twist the narrative
"Freedom lies in being bold
Robert Frost"
They are liars
And Sunak and starmer are backing genocide this is not what the British people stand for
So we trust sky news now Really Glenn
"The ceasefire has allowed the light of truth to shine into the horror of this Genocide carried out under cover of darkness  both in terms of no electricity  of nighttime bombing
Now theyre providing the evidence of the ethnic cleansing they are committing"
War criminals
Any proof of that Looks more like Hamas is shooting
"Israeli terrorist  75 years of occupation

Coward Israeli terrorist  children murderers 

God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs
Allah is allsufficient for us and the best one to trust in"
Israeli snipers opened the fire and shots on the crowd filled with men but also women and children families Alex Crawford about Israeli soldiers who shot Palestinians on their way to the north of Gaza to look for family members
"Notice a shift in rhetoric with MSM like Sky news and the BBC

Even they have reached a breaking point And that is saying something

They would never report such events It is clear that Zionist propaganda machine is slowly dissembling"
How many civilians did IOF kill on oct 7th 100 confirmed apache helicopter  tanks fired on civiliansinvestigation stalled until after war intifada reports using israeli intel —  
And the world is watching
ButbutHamas etc etc
So it has only taken 48 days for Sky to finally start to wake up Slowly but surely
I am revolted by The Zionists and their apologists  People who support zionism disgust me  I will not vote for anyone who supports Israel
Was waiting for confirmation for this story because it seems so nonsensical why do this Horrid and if you believe in justice there has to be accountability for this Snipers shooting into crowds is just criminal
Jesus Christ of almighty
War crime continues during ceasefire
War creminlas do what they do always
There’s no crime that is too much for them to commit
One word …… Barbaric
Funny how they forgot to mention this on the other channels
Israels actions have been brought to light and they are widely criticized as some of the most disliked due to perceived barbaric behavior
Absolutely disgusting 
This is what Israel has been doing for years
No words describe this horrific all too familiar war crime behaviour by Israeli soldiers 
They are the lowest of the low
 which was filled with men but also women  children families  Even when reporting the truth … it is very telling
Thats the most moral military in the world
For the Israelis a ceasefire means Hamas has to stop not them
This is what israhell occupation was doing for years
They always break promises and break covenants
During the ceasefire That is bad
"Where’s mr 
piersmorgan"
Isn’t there a ceasefire
Psychopaths
Snipers They were spraying lead everywhere
War Crimes
Shocking
Heartbreaking
Ceasefire
Ceasefire
Zionist Israel Laknatullah
They are shameless
Absolute scum zionist bastds
So they’re breaking the ceasefire day 1
"because of 
netanyahu
 IsraeliPM
 was so pathethic"
Cowards  And criminals
They very clearly told people not to go back North
Israel soldier cannot fight like real man
Will the USA or UK condemn Israel for such terrorist practice 
isarelisaterrorist IsraeliNewNazism NetanyahouAcriminalofwar
Oh God
Seems heartless of course people are missing under the rubble and the biggest thing is grief not knowing if someone is dead or alive the hope they survive and the need inside to affirm just what happened there should be no shooting at all it is a ceasefire
It aint the snipers fault they are just looking for a promotion
Is this not what they have been doing for 75 years
Western propaganda media seems to have enough of Arpatheid Israel lies
“The most moral army in the world” Apparently
IsraelIsChildKillerDemons
Israel can have foot soldiers inform Palestinians not to advance to the north and having snipers fire above is dangerous to say the least during a ceasefire period Israel please use common human sense
Sky News is fake news
Her plastic surgeon needs to be fired
Because North Gaza is being ethnically cleansed
ISREAL SNIPERS FIRED INTO CROWDS OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN INJUREING AND KILLING TWO THIS HAPPENED TODAY THIS IS BEYOND DISGUSTING
"Looking for your family members and going back to the houses IDF demolished is a serious threat to Israeli safety right 
JoeBiden
  and 
JustinTrudeau
its all selfdefense Shame"
I have never from day one believed Israel not to violate the ceasefire deal They have never been honest and they will never be Hypocrisy lies and false propaganda is what they are good at Why shooting at innocent women children old and men for returning back to the land
"She acknowledged Palestinian children 
P45 in the post"
evil
Wars and truces have their moral rules Israel was established by gangs gathered from all countries of the world Do not be rooted
Firing on noncombatants in other words These are war crimes The holocaust was horrible But why are you as a people taking it out on the the people muslims that have historically protected the chosen people
People are trying to get back to collect animals and belongs 
End the Gazacaust now
How is this news this is what the Israeli Genocidal Force do on a daily basis The IGF have murdered over 14000 civilians since the start of their Genocidal assault on the Palestinian people EndIsraeliGenocide
Israel nazi
"How is this even remotely acceptable legal permissablewhere is the UN Where is sanity
The Isreali Government is vile loathsome and one can only wonder why it has US UK and EU support"
"Based on all statements and actions of Israel and its Western backers they are trying to ethnically cleanse northern Gaza and annex it

Some of us already said this but people are not paying enough attention And no politician is doing anything concrete to stop that"
A savage and brutal people Their true nature has been unveiled
Twitter really didnt want to load this video
I wonder how many of those planning to march on Sunday think this is Israel defending itself
Isn’t that terrorism
"Isreali hostages
Palestine prisoners

Were on to you msm"
Whats been happening lately 
And they were told not too 
Imagine what will happen after the 4 days
if true this is really abominable Disgusting
Camera captures
I think they said it was closed and to move to the South
Hamas snipers
Don’t believe anything sky or bbc says anymore sorry
But wont show the footage What a surprise
"Irgun
So much
CDN"
Shame on the bringthemhomenow
This monkey nation will never be but promise
So wheres the video
VoTE blue nO maTTEr wHat
Wasnt it part of the agreement not to return to the North because its still a war zone  Ceasefire 7am hamas fire rockets at Israel 715am 
Israel breaks the cease fire
Not true
It’s an unpalatable truth  but if a country is attacked it will fight back  if October 7th had not happened we would not be where we are today 
the terms of the truce allowed movement from “north to south” we’ve known this for days
When an army tells you not to go somewhere you should listen
Over under for time to reaction  2 days
Not true
They deserve it 
Source of news hamas
But in the bloody arithmetic of Hamas’s leaders the carnage is not the regrettable outcome of a big miscalculation Quite the opposite they say It is the necessary cost of a great accomplishment
Release the hostages That simple
Outrageous lies What proof has she that Israeli snipers were responsible as opposed to the far more likely HamasIsis snipers
"Reconnect with their Hamas family
Every sane person would stay away from the war zone Only Hamas fighters are eager to going back"
Israel way to do business
They can’t go back to the north according to the ceasefire agreement
"Fact check

There is no evidence to support this claim"
Why do people dondumb things and blame israel They were warned north Gaza is a war zone
I don’t think the war was declared over What did they think would happen
Could be Hamas soldiers getting back into position
If only SkyNews could be trusted for something…
These are murders And murders by military men of civilians during a war this is a war crime
That’s Hamas’ MO Not the IDF
ABC of Israel DNA killing civilians children and women What is new in what happened
They need to release the video if its true
This is 100 true
I guess all the fliers passed out telling people that returning is dangerous and forbidden were true
Tell me again how it is Hamas that Cant be trusted to keep a Cease fire
The enemy is Islam
History repeats itself
Sky liars
Much as every decent person hates war Id wouldnt mind seeing  Israel Defense Force having to confront a real army whether the Syrian Arabs the Russians or the Ukrainians  Theyre cowards
Israel snipers  later blame hamas What a tactics Uncivilzed zionist
"When asked why the Israeli forces were shooting dead protesters at the Gaza crossings
Michal Maayan — Well we cant put all these people in jail"
They were told not to return warned over and over again Sent fliers not to return But still they tried Shots fired in air did not deter them so they were shot in the legs A couple died It is a war If told not to return  don’t
All the while the Hamas government of Palestine praise them for being killed
"Dafna Elyakim is only 14 and is held imprisoned by Hamas with her sister EllaHer father was killed and she was there when it happened
Her fathers partner was forced to lure even more children out of their homes so that Hamas "

How many young Muslim men would it take to march on London not to protest or climb statues but to storm our Parliament  seats of government The police would be too weak to stop them so the Army would have to be called in And would we have enough soldiers and tanks to do so

The police officer was being way too polite here
I thought no one was allowed to have their face covered

Police allow him to continue to conceal his identity even after committing a crime for which we was not arrested of course
Get off the art you disgusting people show some respect
You need to come down sir if that ok with you its fine if not Sorry Carry on

That’s Europe’s problem not sure why it would be the Palestinians problem in anyway
This is ridiculous lol
That is why we should not have pity of the pumps that falls there
Put her in room with a Jewish person wout knowing their ideology have them work on a project together something simple Video it and at the end of the day reveal who they are to each other then ask them again how they feel about what should be done to the opposite side

The fact that she struggles to answer but eventually says they just need to go away should tell you that she knows deep down what she has to say is wrong but she has to say it because the message is too important to not say
That’s some funny shit
There you have it

The British took it from the Ottoman Empire in WW1 1918 They would never put it in Muslim hands to run because the Muslim Ottomans had just a few years before murdered a couple million Christians in the Armenian Assyrian genocide
Please tell me what is your thesis on the right of Israel to exist when it was a Rothschild bankers project The Haavara Agreement  Hebrew הֶסְכֵּם הַעֲבָרָה transfer agreement was an agreement between Nazi Germany and Zionist German Jews signed on 25 August 1933
It was just an area populated by farmers living peacefully on their land But because they were not a state and without the apparatus of state nor an army to defend themselves Jews felt entitled to infiltrate steal land and through terrorism establish their own state
David and Jews ruled there before Palestine was even a NAME
Palestine was the name of the land where Jews Muslims and Christians lived and they were all called Palestinians There was no Palestinian nation and most of todays Palestinian Arabs came from Jourdan

It wasnt a country
Rule of thumb if a photo purports to show a scene of modern development in Palestine prior to 1948 chances are it was built by Jews
"Even

 is tired of your "
My dude wait til you see what it looked like before Muslim invaders
It was British territory Then they decided to attack Israel Several times Lost every single time But still not learned the lesson
"It was not a country Show me where it was ever a country with borders verified internationally 

Oh wait You can’t"
of course it wasnt empty it was full of Jews who built that city
It most certainly was not a country
Of all the lands there are for dismal scenery I think Palestine must be the prince…  Renowned Jerusalem itself the stateliest name in history has lost all its ancient grandeur and is become a pauper village the riches of Solomon are no longer there to compel the admiration…
"in 10 years when Arabs will start to blow themselves inside school buses in London and Paris you will post images of Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower to claim it was always Muslim entities
Good luck to the English and French people who push back those claims"
Looks like a lot of Jews
This was Israel Theres no need to lie
Beginning in 1933 the Jerusalem neighborhood of Rehavia established as a Garden City in the early 1920s became the epicenter of Israels GermanJewish community
It seems this is inaccurate please revise
Nothing about this picture is Palestinian This is a photo in 1940 in Shlomzion Halmulka Jerusalem It’s absolutely mind blowing that you’d lie so blatantly about this 
"You are making up history The neighborhood  a Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem
 There is no such thing as Palestine there never was"
This photo is of Princess Mary Avenue in west Jerusalem The photo shows the Rex Cinema Given that it is likely to have been an area with significant Jewish and Christian presence and certainly one influenced by the British mandate  rather than showing arab development
"Certainly not empty  This is a JEWISH area  This is very well covered in a community note  This image is from the book “German Jerusalem The Remarkable Life of a GermanJewish Neighborhood in the Holy City” circa 1920 British Mandate period 
You sir aim to tell a…"
Those  schools colleges theaters concerts culture and art were all Jewish Palestinian Post became the Jerusalm Post Palestine Symphony became the Israeli Philharmonic Because they were Jewish projects named after the region Palestine they wereiving in under British…
Palestinians are under the impression that Jordan Lebanon and Germany are lands that were stolen from them They attacked them the same way they attacked Israel
And then the hate started Hate the Jews and pay the dues This whole thing has to stop
Stop appropriating our history That is a Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem during the British mandate
Haha    Did you bother  to zoom in  on those pictures and notice the Hebrew signs
You are aware that this is a Jewish neighborhood and that it is one of the few that looked like this right
Indeed lets laud the British

“Palestine” is a figment of your imagination There was never a Palestinian state in all of history there isn’t one now and there never will be
Except that it was literally not a country
"There west Government of Palestine mandate from british governement pre1948 that expired on 1948 

So yes there were natural born palestinian citizen there and there jews that comes from outside the area that naturalized and have the same rights with natural born 

So…"
muslims where not like that in 1948
After two and a half centuries of Mamluk rule Jerusalem changed hands and became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1516
Can you think of anything reason why 95 of the pictures that prove Palestine was nice nonempty etc are from a Jewish place in PalestineIsrael This time Shlomtzion ShalomTzion in Jerusalem Its actually a place named TsionZionist in Hebrew Thanks for Sharing
"Yes and all that live in this photo is Jewish
It’s called Tel Aviv thanks for your support to Israel "
"These pathetic goons have only one play which is to lie constantly and brazenly It comes easily to them easy as breathing Their whole culture is based on it 

Intentionally erasing a people’s history is a soft form of genocide That’s what Mohamad here is taking part in…"
That is secondary What matters is the legal framework The area was controlled by the Ottomans and ceded to administer to the British with the British Mandate There was no legal entity called Palestine and the state of Israel was created legally and it exists legally…
"On Palestine

Talk about “ ignorant”  Nice revisionist history but in reality the area was part of the Ottoman Empire  guess “occupied” by them and before them others until the British defeated them  “occupied” by Brit’s and then the area was partially given to Jordan and the rest to be…
"And you think Palestine was invaded by Israel in 1948

The Jews there have been developing the land to bring it to prosperity
Palestine was very sparsely populated

Without Jews there is no Palestine Everyone was leaving the region in search of better life until the Jews…"
I do not see any arabic letters here
What was their currency
Yes and lots of Jewsbecause palestine even in the 40s and 50s was JEWISH
Can someone please add a Community Note noting the following This photo taken in 1940 in Shlomzion Hamalka in Jerusalem depicts almost entirely a Jewish neighborhood showcasing Jewish culture and heritage
so why do you post a photo from a district in Jerusalem built and inhabited mostly by Jews
All build by JEWS
Yeah I can clearly see a bunch of Arabs in that picture Interestingly they look a like like Jewish residents of that area looked and not at all like the Arab residents looked I wonder what that means
It wasnt country it was an occupied territory
Zionists lies
Developed by the Brits lol You’re a clown
It was British Palestine a colony of Britain
country called Egypt
Built and run by the Jews
"Hey 
CommunityNotes
 check this one"
Zoom in Look at the womenlook at their hair Theres your real issue In the 1940s and 50s the MidEasts denizens were mostly secular muslims Today they are mostly radical Islamoterrorists
Oh yes it was Until the rats invaded it
"There is no one Palestinian institution in Palestine 

Yet you know what it did have 

The western wall

The Hebrew university in Jerusalem opened  1918 second building ceremony 1925"
Where did the Jews come from before they were dispersed
"This was mainly a Jewish neighborhood in West Jerusalem built by Jewish immigrants from Germany 

"
Queen Mary Street was paved by the British and at its end was a British headquarters Also in the photo Rex Cinema the famous movie theater in Jerusalem that was owned by partners a Jew and an ArabChristian
"Palestine will be free 
We will never stop talking about them NEVER"
So was Israel a country before palenstinefor centuries
That’s a jewish street under the British mandate Nothing ”Palestinian” here
You know fine well that it wasnt a country but a region and was named that by invading forces Please try to get the history right
It look better than my country at the same year

He who lost history is he who demolished ones tale insha Allah freedom for Palestine and paletinians
GEE
Britain did a lot of nice development in that area of the world
Trust me if they can rename flowers like the Poinsettia and move borders around during times of peace they can do anything we mean nothing to these people were either in their way of them taking more or were not and if you are in their way not good stay close to God
Well Palestine and Syria are lands of the Prophets There were so many Prophets from these countries It’s a holy land How someone can do evil on streets and places where their Prophets stepped onto Were not there Prophet Mosses Haroon Yousaf Yaqoob Issa Mary Ibrahim…
Which town  street does it show Looks like the jewish quarter in Jerusalem to me…
Israel could not discover a land already occupied
5 years’ll be 4 score praying for bridges
its a street in the Jewish side of Jerusalem
thank you for sharing that I didnt know that
British came built a train rail way before 48 This it what you see in this picture Auto’s and buses brought by England
looks wonderful
"In the picture 
An area that never belonged to Palestinians"
All the work of Christians and Jews
It was a beautiful country full of culture 
Show me one reference well accepted reference where it was referred to as palestine in the first place
Airports LoL
The prophet spread his faith by conquest didnt he  The land had been handed to England after the Turks left Then it was given to Jews which is their inheritance under Abraham
Palestine was Like Berouththeir architecture was similar to Paris 
Please provide the date Palestine became a country name of their first leader capital city and monetary system Also provide the date it became a member of the UN
The result of British mandate as in so many places in the world So what
Right And the shop sign in the background is in Hebrew  why exactly
It’s hard to imagine why those who made the decision did not foresee the decades of conflict and loss of lives It will never end
Yes and it was under British rule
"This is Shlomtzion HaMalka street in Jerusalem first of all its named on British Princess Mery and the second jews first started to build outside the walls of Old Jerusalem
so its  double fake about beautiful Palestine before the Jewish State has established"
The proZionist comments show an interesting insight into apartheid ideology This sense of illusion also underpinned the Nazi ideology that influenced the ruling Afrikaaners of South Africa The resemblance are uncanny
"1 There was no country called Palestine before 1948 
2 The land that became the League of Nationssponsored British Mandate for Palestine was indeed an undeveloped backwater under its previous rulers the Ottomans"
There was a geographic entity that Europeans called Palestine and there was a League of Nations territory allocated to Britain called the Palestine Mandate The British broke off 75 of the eastern part to create the kindgom of Transjordan which it gave to its Hashemite allies…
Not sure what your point is
There was a region of the Ottoman Empire that Europeans but not the Ottomans called Palestine When the Empire broke up the League of Nations provided a Mandate for the British to rule Palestine The British almost immediately took 70 of it and made a new country called…
Yes It was a British protectorate It was not a separate country by any definition
The point which all of you are missing is that it was a thriving area It didnt have to hope Israel gave them enough water have Israel come to their houses kick them out then demolish their homes One minute youre having dinner five min later everything you own is gone
It shouldnt be difficult but for some reason too many Arabs do find it difficult and they try to eliminate Israel and constantly fail
Imagine forcing yourself onto someone’s land then expecting them to be ok with it The Jewish people who lived there before stand with Palestinians Israel was meant for Israelites and you’re not them Settler colonialism and the Zionist colonial project will fail
He also put the mufti in his position because 1 the muftis brother had moderate views and 2 the Husseinis pressured and boxed out the other notable families Haj Amin wasnt even one of the final three names from whom the officeholder was to be selected
Is there something I said above that you think is untrue Because none of it is the least bit controversial just historical facts
It wasnt a country but effectively a post Ottoman Empire administrative district And those cities and culture They werent built by Bedouin or immigrant fellahin Jews didnt just show up in 1948

"The British band Police wrote a song called Invisible Sun Stewart Copeland band member who grew up in Beiruit said the song was about Lebanon And how the media was so wrong about the place

A friend of mine lives outside Beiruit Thankfully hes safe For now"
After the Ottoman Empire lost control of the area it was under British rule It wasn’t a desolate wasteland it also wasn’t “ Palestine”  there’s no such thing in history
Does not look like Palestine Does not look llike a Muslim country Where is this
Palestine was never in history an independent country
"What do you think is there now

If the answer is anything else then exactly the same things you will be lying"
England built
Yes
Was occupied by jordan if i remember Was not palestine
More Palestinian history for anyone who is interested
There has NEVER bern a country of Palestine Learn some history Jewish people were the people of the area in and around Jerusalem for thousands of years before “Palestinians” became a word
No true but good try
It was the Ottoman Empire  Now an Ottoman is something I put my feet on
These are additiial photd roving hat
This is a jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem
Prior to 1948 it was British  Prior to WWI it was the Ottoman Empire  Palestine was not a country

Gaza will be annexed by the state of Israel if Hamas and Hezbollah are unable to successfully fight off the IDF ground forces This means the rest of the people will be exterminated if Israel wins Maybe some will be relocated although no other nations are open to that now
Nope none at all…this is area of peace loving Hamas…

There are no comments on the Palestinians in the 1000s most of whom have not been charged just detained for months and years That doesnt seem fair
Vote bank politics at play
What about HAMAS Hezbollah
RESPECT 
Followed
"Take a seat
You are not in a position to tell another country how they going to defend themselves
You should be condemning the terrorists and let Israel finish Hamas"
I Support Gazza
This is one of the men who organised the protest today Why do you hate women and LGBT so much
the power of Allah
Brave
And then everything will be ok will it The Muslims will not rest until the whole of Palestine is due Jew free
So you’re perfectly happy with these guys marching with you
And you openly support Hamas if you stood with this guy
I demand binding peace    She makes Neville Chamberlain look like Churchill
Proud of you 
I hoped more MP’s had the same backbone and morals you had to say and do what you did 
Well done Claudia
Shud be wearing a hijab and protesting for implementing Sharia law next 
Thanks
I thought this was forbidden in the Labour Party
Do you condemn Hamas attacks on Jews 
Are you sure you know exactly what ‘Free Palestine ‘ means  Are you listening to the hate  speeches during the London demo today Please be sure you understand clearly is happening
ISIS flag at the March…you support this
Thank you Claudia  thats the right thing to do It must be really difficult staying in Labour right now And Im not sure if you should or shouldnt But solidarity and respect to you
"So are you asking for Israeli hostages if they’re still alive to be released 
Or have you forgotten about those"
"You dont condemn Hamas at the same time then

Thats because you have no moral compass

As a UK Member of Parliament that is incredibly worrying"
Solidarity Claudia
Of course you are an antisemitic Labour MP there’s a surprise …
And What exactly did that achieve Maybe take the mob to Palestine and impress folks Love the little warriors screeching from behind the barricades
This is absurd for an MP 
Agree I also condemn Hamas’s crimes against Israelis It’s not eitheror
I have given up on the MPs we have in this country It is a total shambles and Westminster is nothing more than a scam now
"Standing with terrorist sympathisers 
No surprise really "
When a picture paints a thousand words
You are a disgrace resign
Love all the people in London who care humanity
But strangely not condemning the atrocities carried out by Hamas
Love it 
All I had to do was see which constituency you represented to understand your loyalties and the fact that you would support terrorists Can’t upset the base now
What do you say about Hamas murdering unarmed civilians
Where is your condemnation of Hamas  We are waiting …
This conflict is driven by jealousy and obstinacy rather than land Jews reside in a tiny enclave while Muslims occupy the vast expanse
"Hindi translation

As a Member of Parliament of Britain I will not remain silent or will not remain silentI will not stand in favor of war or will not cheerI stood in Whitehall with 300000 people who marched with marble arch

Do you condemn this lot too
I don’t think Hamas pays attention to demands  
The sooner you’re voted out the better  why hasn’t the whip been withdrawn 
Another one supporting Hamas by the back door  Shame on you 
As a British Member of Parliament I will not remain silent or silenceI will not watch whether the war was encouraging with 300000 people in Whitehall who marched from Marble Arched I condemned the war crimes of Israel against Gaza We demand a ceasefire
"You are wrong as always

A violent criminal joins a march for peace
The fact you are still a member of parliament says a lot about our Country any other person in a job would have been sacked or at least resigned
Have you condemned Hamas’s war crimes in Israel Madam
Why would I be interested in what a convicted criminal has to say on this or any other subject
Solidarity Claudia for standing against the hypocrites
"When labour show you what they are … believe them We had 
KeirStarmer
 suggesting he stood with Israel for the atrocities which were imposed on them Well… this is what 
UKLabour
 really believe obvs"
Release of hostages  was this an afterthought Claudia For peace process to even begin release of the hostages should be the top agenda
Sickening hypocrites
No mention of the victims of Hamas terrorists though
"You marched with people waving ISIS flags

We saw"
Looks exactly like your cheered on war to be honest
Please expand on what a ‘free Palestine’ actually looks like…
Who’s going to take notice of a criminal
How about the Hamas war crimes did you condemn them

FREE PALESTINE WE ARE WITH YOU CLARE
Europe has fallen Very sad
Thank you very much for your humanitarian efforts
Mostly Muslim minorities most other people do not care
Hamas is not representative of the rights of Palestine
"From all over the world
World stand with Gaza
World stands with Humanity and Truth against GazaGenocide and WarCrimesbyIsreal"
America too well it does now
What about Hamas acts of terrorism
"Neither do you

The arrogance of ‘Europe stands with Palestine’ is breathtaking

Which of you stands with the hostages"
You are one of a kind  thank you for being real human 
Funny how the governments says one thing but the people says another
"“A baby was cut out of a pregnant woman and beheaded and then the mother was beheaded”

“Mass rape so brutal that they broke their victims’ pelvis – women grandmothers children”

“We have babies with their heads cut off Bodies without hands without legs without genitals”"
The EU leaders should be embarrassed and ashamed of their hypocrisy
Good woman and strong woman 
You are the best politic i have ever seen

So you stand with Hamas
Ms Daly you are a wonderful human being
starting to think EU elections are as rigged as US elections
There is no genocide
You dont speak for me
Europeans elected them so they represent Europe not the Moslem Brotherhood or its few European associates
And what about Hamas’ war crimes
"No it doesn’t

Just because people are scared to congregate in support of Israel doesn’t mean they support palatine and Hamas"
"Kudos to the people who understand well and sympathize with the people of other countries Hoping for a day 
when the savior will save everyone Do you know who he is

Sick idiots let them be treated
Stand with Israel 
You don’t speak for the people either
HAMASISIS
No  Muslims stand with other muslims
An Irish European MEP must surely be the ultimate in grifting
No The IDF communicates with them first before they attack Then they drop a small bomb on the top as a final warning before they drop the building  Unlike Hamas they don’t want innocents killed
You asked for war
You know the civilians were warned Hamas is using human shields by placing their assets in residential buildings
Well done Israel
Hamas was also in the building and Israel gave an hour warning
We call this halfass journalism
War crimes r only counted if perpetrators r of anti west front if it is committed by US western allies then it is not a war crime but fighting terrorists
Hamas cells were operating out of here Clear W
They were warned not to mention the building was being used to house terrorists and manufacture weapons and explosives
They knock the roof to tell people to get out and you know that  It’s the hamas terrorists conducting war crimes
"War never changes

Maybe you should advocate for peace instead of throwing out buzz words to feed the beast"
Take that for your war crime 
All Gaza is terorist HQ
war crime is what hamas just did to civilians yes there would be consequences they forgot to think
Oh wah now youre worried about war crimes I hope they turn that whole area into a parking lot
I guess youve missed some of the news before now You will now witness what happens when you murder women and children I dont care what happens Not At All
Sending 5000 missiles and rockets into Israel is even more of a war crime  I dont think Palestinians can complain whatever happens now in response or retaliation They deserve it  All of them
Journos right now
You are committing War Crimes and gloating over it  When a day comes in which like Hitler Israel has to answer your comments will be there to see in your participation of the Genocide of Palestinians
Sorry but nothing that Palestinians can say now really means anything after what they have said here 
GFY Alan
Oh you are concerned about war crimes
But but but it’s a good war crime” and you have to learn the difference between good war crimes Israel and bad war crimes Hamas Turkey Iran Vladimir Putin    
No a war crime is killing innocent civilians raping them  parading them through the streets
Send their asses to the 42 virgins that await them 
Hamas occupied building legitimate target
so a day which started with war crimes ends with one as well
What do you think we mean when we say “war” Hint It is this but it’s not what you saw happen to the Israelies this morning
Nuts
Gaza needs the Dresden treatment
Only solution is to give back Palestinian their land
Israel should level every building in Gaza
"What are the odds Alan isnt heterosexual and fetishizes being dominated by Islamic militants

Id wager 100"
Some jokers will say its hamas headquarters
Eye for an eye Hamas shouldn’t have started with war crimes
Good needed to be done
Dude it’s just a building They warned them before bombing it Meanwhile call out the war crime by Hamas
If you didnt get the full story Israel asked the occupants to leave the building
The explosions started at ground level and then the building fell straight down I dont believe that was an airstrike
you get what you put out
Sure but housed Hamas terrorists So no
Save your outrage This is only the beginning of the dismantling of Hamas infrastructure Palestinians  had 75 yrs to make peace Gaza had 20 yrs to become another Dubai after Israel’s unilateral withdrawal  ditching the ‘land for peace’ principle cos of international pressure
Wait til you hear about what all happened before that
Why would they do that totally completely  utterly out of the blue  Its a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma…
How many people were in that building
"There is an extensive compilation of war crimes committed by the Israeli occupiers
Since 1948"
Hypocrisy of Western Media 
Netanyahu finds himself entangled drawn towards the demands of extreme rightwing factions that sustain his political survival and shroud him from the weight of corruption allegations In the eyes of the secular majority within Israel  and the global community his actions are…
When you send 5000 missiles into Israel what do you expect Ever heard of cause and effect
LMAO Jounalist has thoughts
Conflicts devastating impact knows no boundaries affecting both lives and infrastructure Its a grim reminder of the toll of war
Good
"You forgot about the part where the IDF clears the civilians out of the building through repeated warnings to Palestian leaders they are targeting the building 

Yes a very noble strategy that unfortunately results in not enough bad guys getting killed"
Nothing is a crime if it is against Hamas Let this sink in
war crimes by Israel
Hamas apologist
Hit it again
Sure Now what did Hamas did with innocent civilians going on with their lives a few hours prior in Israel In your view are they formal army following Geneva conventions
Looks like a good start to me
War crimes is such a strange concept Its war
Nonsense it was a control demolition They had actors film crews  SAR already pre positioned all around the building all laughing as they “blow it up”
Is this current
Controlled explosions 
Free Palestinian
Is it though  I mean if they were using it for military purposes it isnt  Doesnt seem clear to me
Thats an answer to this clear war crime 
This you
Go away
You know nothing about international law it seems The building was used as a Hamas barracks
Not if its war darling
War crime
Yes Certainly the victory of Allah is near
This video from 2021 lol
Serve them right they asked for it
“War crime” is a nonsensical concept invented by the West to label their enemies
Im sure they will and have broken all the rules on both sides
Nazi alert
Israel marked the building with a lighter round first to let everyone know it was a target and that they should leave
Not even close to a war crime
Clear On what basis If it housed command andor control elements of Hamas was it still a “clear” war crime You’re a journalist so it’s fundamental to your profession to exaggerate or fabricate narratives
Hamas Headquarters
Now level the rest of it
What This was a Hamas HQ And they even gave them a warning shot for noncombatants to evacuate
It wasnt As you can see from the Al Jazeera broadcast they knocked first to give everyone a chance to evacuate
It’s just a collateral damage
They took hostages Pretty sure the rules are out the window
It was empty Israel warns occupants before it levels buildings
There was a warning strike It was caught on live TV
"Oh Russian 
MintPressNews
  Want to hear your comments on Russian atrocities in Ukraine  But Im sure you will be silent"
The Earth has reached its limit in tolerating more wars past experiences have shown that they do not produce any significant outcomes War is not a solution
"chill man isreal is defending itself
lol"
Ya  Israel seems to really dislike media companies in Gaza It is not the first time they have targeted media buildings  and or journalists in the occupied territories I guess they don’t want the truth to get out And that would be the truth about their war crimes
They gave everyone a roof knock beforehand so whats your issue That was a Hamas office building
You are a clear example of a beta male who talks big behind a keyboard but wont put his money where his mouth is
"Its where Hamas has headquarters
Behind civilians
Theyre not innocent civilians because they know they harbor Terrorists"
"Were coming for our children elderly women and men who were kidnapped to Gaza yesterday Alive or dead theyll get home
I feel sad about all the people whom Hamas uses as human shields but they wont stop us from bringing our children back"
Israel has been committing war crimes since 1948
When it is done by someone who supports the USA it is called defense and when it is done by someone who does not support the USA then it is called terrorism
Not a war crime  This was justified
If Hamas is using the building its a military target for Israel If there are civilians there the war criminal is Hamas Using human shields is a war crime
The “war crime” slogan been gettin tossed around a lot nowadays It’s always fun to see because it’s a clear indicator of which side that person has chosen
Looks like a movie scene whereas its real
I would be willing to wager everyone was warned that they were going to take it down and the there were no civilians in it when it was destroyed unless the warning wasnt listened to
This is an old video  have seen this video before the recent escalation
Liar
Epic I love watching this reminds me of watching the Iraq invasion and the early 2000s The difference is that this one is justified This one is great content I hope Israel finishes this off for one state solution
I guess you conveniently left out the fact that Israel gave warning to the building before taking it down
It housed AP media officers etc however they did in fact give  MINUTES notice before the bombings for everyone to vacate the building More than the other side
Israel had the decency to warn them
Pathetic
Right so you expect Israel to stand still while its citizens are being killed
They were warned
HQ for Hamas in Gaza Legitimate military target
What else was in there Alan  you hack
It doesn’t count when you are West or Israël That’s western rule based order
Response to a war crime
Military target   Well deserved
So what
Yes and a Hamas command and control operation in the basement
Sturdy architecture they’ve got in Gaza
Not a war crime if it had Hamas offices as reported or if they gave warning to civilians to evacuate beforehand as the IDF usually does
Israel never gets this people without homeland will never sit silent Give them their home back and live in peace
Two towers in Gaza City which host media offices and residential apartments collapsed after they were hit by an airstrike It was not immediately clear if there were casualties Follow CNN for live updates as Israel says its at war after today’s surprise attack by Hamas…

You are kidding right
awwwwww
Stay tuned more to come Gaza will soon be turned into a parking lot  something useful at least
Im presuming they knocked first which the palestinians  absolutely did not
Good  because Palestine started this 
Ooo u should have also be there in those towers
Was the bombing of Berlin by the Russians in 1945 also a war crime War is a boomerang Its amazing how people dont understand this Oddly most of them seem to work in the media
"Oh no Were your offices in there like the 
AP
"
Weird how quiet the jets are
Feast to my eyes
Israel is champion in acting victim
Reality is people started talking about Palestinian Israeli conflict when palestine attacked they called them terrorists when Israel has a wide range of history of doing everything palestine did and worse Im hoping palestine wins and hoping if it doesnt
Not a war crime    War
Foff
Cry harder
Yea…thats war for ya
The same buildings were being used to launch rockets
Dont  mess with Israel

Remember Israel has right to defend themselves at any cost"
Vivid as day They commit crimes over and over and over No one tells them off

910 for the acting Very convincing

Its an avalanche of lies
A Pallywood Production
its not phosphor
Lol its just smoke
Pallywood producers go brrrr
You don’t put out white phosphorus with water  the propaganda runs deep with Hamas
If that was WP then why are they out there with buckets of water
"Looks more like someone’s dirty underwear caught fire 
Pallywood"
"See  It has been proven a lie An honest person would deleteretract this but HamasPalestine and their supporters are not honest 

They have no truth to stand on so they rely on spreading lies Without lies they would have nothing to say"

"A bunch of Hamas fighters just waiting for it to drop
100 Palliwood"
Always lying Hamas terrorist supporters and getting caught
Why are the kids running to it then 
The propensity to lie is amazing   No phosphorous bomb there
That is a smoke bomb stop lying to your followers
"Do you think these people represent Hamas Why are Gaza schools being bombed with internationally banned white phosphorus
These schools are attended by civilians and are affiliated with UNRWA"
Its illegal and war crime to drop white phosphorus on civilians
"And just like that they’re all scientists… 

You don’t have to be too smart to see this is just regular smoke Leave that area"
Staged propaganda They’re terrible at making fake videos It’s humorous
"Notice how the Palestinian
State sponsored medias wont show this to the public  All they want to do is stir up hate among the people  Expose the lies people  Dont be blinded by the  media "
Hahhahahhahahahahahaha
 investigative journalist 
Funny its almost as if they knew someone was going to throw it off the top of the adjacent building lol
Hahahahaha thats a smoke bomb like we played with on Independence day 
False news  That is a common smoke canister
"This is a guy with a following on Instagram of 2 million
White phosphorus cannot be put out with little water or other conventional methods
You can see the second canister being thrown off the building behind them

Fake news"
They use lethal weapons against civilians 
Lmfao what is this even supposed to be
If it was 2001 they would call it “White Cake”
A PHD candidate that doesnt know how phosphorous burns
this is a parody account right
They are doing it deliberately to prove a bigger conflict and are committing war crimes knowing that they will get away with it they think no one can hold them accountable 
Thats not WP  Get a clue then speak
That guy looks pretty well rested for being under siege for 3 weeks
Thats not white phosphorous This is what white phosphorous looks like Those are plain old smoke grenades
FakeNews
"another L
you re collecting them"
The thing that amazes me is that your lies are so blatantly obvious that nobody believes you There’s no chance that anybody with integrity would take you seriously
nice smoke grenades lmao
This looks like smoke Did you verify they authenticity of this 
FAKE NEWS Thats not what a bomb looks like You really got to try harder with that fake news
This is a propaganda clip and a very bad one at that
This is not white phosphorus
"Free Free Palestine 

CeasefireForGaza"
Its smoke
One can clearly See this fake video 
This is just smoke
Tell me more about all these people waiting around with buckets before the bomb even hits the ground Look closely you can see the guy running over with a bucket before it even hits the ground
White phosphorus burns at 1500°f800°C that is smoke
Yeah that not what white phosphorus looks like
Breaking Sulaiman posted another weak piece of propaganda
Looks like a smoke grenade got thrown  Looks like propaganda videos
Just like Israel bombed a hospital
Pretty odd that people are running up to an actively dispersing “chemical weapon” with no visible effects
It’s war time Unfortunately there are no crimes If there were your side did them first Instead of stirring up more crap against one another why don’t you turn your negative energy into positive
